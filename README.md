# **Serverless API with Infrastructure as Code using Terraform**

This project leverages **Terraform** to deploy a serverless API on AWS, utilizing a range of serverless services for efficient and scalable application development. The technology stack includes:

- **Terraform**: Infrastructure as Code tool for automating the provisioning of AWS resources.
- **AWS API Gateway**: Endpoint management to create, publish, maintain, monitor, and secure APIs at scale.
- **AWS Lambda**: Serverless compute service for executing code without provisioning or managing servers.
- **DynamoDB**: Fully managed NoSQL database for storing application data with seamless scalability.
- **Amazon Cognito**: Provides authentication, authorization, and user management for your web and mobile apps.
- **CloudWatch**: Monitoring and logging service for serverless applications, ensuring operational visibility.

This setup offers a serverless architecture that scales with demand, ensuring high availability, low operational overhead, and cost efficiency. Ideal for modern applications needing flexible, scalable backend services without managing infrastructure.
